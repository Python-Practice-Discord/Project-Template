# Project Name 
**Brief Project Description Here**

#### Project Manager:
- Joe Schmoe

## How to Contribute:
First, if you're in the Discord, make sure that you've joined the GitHub organization. 

If you'd like to  join the core project team, which we're limiting to 10 people, you can reach out to a project manager or moderator and request to join. This will be first-come first-serve, and we will remove inactive contributors from the team  periodically to make space for new comtributors.

If the team is full, or if you don't want to join the core team, you are still welcome to fork the project repository, and create a pull request to merge your changes with the rest of the project.

## Code Best Practices
We're waiting on PeterHoburg for this.
