## How to Contribute:
### If you're not in the Python_Practice Discord:
You have a few options. The best option is to join our community over on Discord. We're open to anyone looking to learn or improve their skills at Python. Otherwise, you're welcome to fork this repository and pull-request your changes, or open GitHub issues with requests or ideas for another contributor to do.
### If you're in the Discord:
First, make sure you've joined the GitHub Organization as a member. Next, contact a Moderator or Group Project Manager in Discord and ask them to add you to the Project Team. Once you're in, start voulenteering on issues you think you can do, and a Project Manager will assign you.

To keep things organized, we ask that you wait for a Project Manager to assign you, then branch and begin working, instead of just changing code. (although you're welcome to fork the repository and do whatever you want to the fork, including pull-requesting back to this repository).
### Important information for contributing:
As stated above, **if you're not working on a fork of this repository**, we ask that you wait for a Project Manager to assign you, then branch and begin working, instead of just changing code.  

Please also ensure you are documenting your code well, making use of docustrings and comments, and you are following the PEP-8 style guide where applicable.
